# Change Policy

This repository defines a **normative reference**, not a product specification.

Stability and clarity are intentional design goals.

## What may change

- Clarifications of wording without changing meaning
- Additional context documents (e.g. examples, mappings, explanations)
- New reference documents that build on the existing model
- Minor version updates (e.g. v1.0 → v1.1) for editorial improvements

## What will not change lightly

- The core principles of the Manifesto
- The meaning of existing Autonomy Levels
- The interpretation of autonomy as a risk factor
- The assumption of technical enforcement over instructional control

## Breaking changes

Changes that alter the meaning of:
- autonomy levels
- risk interpretation
- or core governance principles

require a **major version update** (e.g. v1.x → v2.0)
and explicit rationale.

## Scope boundaries

This reference does not evolve by adding:
- product features
- implementation details
- tool-specific behavior
- vendor-specific guidance

Such material may exist in separate repositories or documents.

## Intent

The purpose of this policy is not to prevent evolution,
but to ensure that evolution is **deliberate, explicit, and accountable**.
