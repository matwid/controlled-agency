# OpenClaw Context

OpenClaw is an open-source project that has rapidly gained adoption because it is capable, flexible, and practically useful.
It provides a powerful runtime for agentic workflows, integrations, and automation.

This repository (**Controlled Agency**) is **not** a competing project and **not** a critique of OpenClaw.
It defines a **design position and governance vocabulary** for operating agentic systems responsibly.

## The core shift

As agent runtimes become more capable, the primary challenge changes:

- from “Can the agent do this?”
- to “Can we operate this agent responsibly in real environments?”

Many environments — teams, organizations, regulated contexts — require more than raw capability:
- explicit autonomy levels
- technically enforced boundaries (not prompt-based promises)
- bounded blast radius
- auditability and accountability
- cost discipline

## Relationship to OpenClaw

OpenClaw focuses on **capability and flexibility**.
Controlled Agency focuses on **making that capability operable under constraints**.

In other words:
- We are not “fixing” OpenClaw.
- We are defining how powerful agent systems can be deployed in a way that remains
  observable, governable, and defensible.

This is a common pattern in open-source ecosystems:
a strong core runtime enables downstream work on operations, hardening, and governance.
