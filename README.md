# Controlled Agency

*A reference for building agentic systems with explicit control and bounded autonomy.*

This repository is **not** a framework and not a product. It is a **design position** and a set of **operator-facing reference documents** for anyone building or deploying AI agents in real systems.

## What this is

- A clear stance: **agency is power**, and power must be governed.
- A practical vocabulary: **autonomy levels**, **technical enforcement**, **blast radius**.
- A starting point for teams who want automation **without** loss of control.

## What this is not

- Not an “autonomous agent” demo.
- Not a prompt collection.
- Not security theater (“the agent is told not to…”).

## Documents

- **MANIFESTO.md** — the design position (the “why”).
- **SOLUTION-NARRATIVE.md** — the application space (the “what”).
- **AUTONOMY-LEVELS.md** — a graduated reference model for autonomy and risk.
- **WHY-NOT-LLM-AND-SCRIPTS.md** — where ad-hoc automation breaks down.
- **OPENCLAW-CONTEXT.md** — how this work relates to the OpenClaw ecosystem.
- **RELATION-TO-EXISTING-WORK.md** — how this reference relates to existing autonomy and governance work. 
- **CHANGE-POLICY.md** — how and when this reference evolves.

## Guiding principles (one screen)

- **Autonomy is a design decision, not a default.**
- **Instructions are not controls** — enforce boundaries technically.
- **The blast radius is the metric** — minimize worst-case impact.
- **Silence is healthy** — no mandate, no action.
- **Cost is a safety constraint** — budgets and limits are governance.
