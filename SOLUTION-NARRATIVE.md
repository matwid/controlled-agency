# Solution Narrative

We build agentic systems to perform complex tasks in real environments.

We do not assume that capability implies safety.
Instead, we treat agency as a source of risk that must be explicitly bounded.

Our agents operate within clearly defined roles, permissions, and limits.
They can be applied to a wide range of tasks — from analysis and coordination
to execution — without requiring implicit trust.

By enforcing technical boundaries, explicit autonomy levels,
and measurable limits on impact and cost,
we enable agentic systems that remain observable, governable,
and accountable in operation.

We do not claim to make agents “safe”.
We make their behavior **constrained, predictable, and defensible**.
